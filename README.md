Miwok App
===================================

This app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language.
Used in a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree.


Personal Notes
--------------
This is my first multi-screen app! It’s a vocabulary app that teaches common words and phrases in Miwok — and includes useful images and pronunciation soundbites.

Topics covered…
- generic Android behaviors
    -> drawables
    -> conditional styling
    -> defined variables (strings.xml, styles.xml, colors.xml)
    -> switch statements
    -> if statements
    -> private methods
    -> XML layouts
- using intents to navigate between activities
- implementing onClickListener interface (to asynchronously listen for clicks!)
- defining a custom object that included multiple constructors
- using ArrayLists — and an Adapter to translate the ArrayList into UI elements
    —> specifically… extended ArrayAdapter class (and list_item.xml) to show multiple TextViews, ImageViews in a ListView list item (instead of default single TextView)
- using MediaPlayer with AudioFocus to appropriately handle audio
- styled and polished UI with redline mockups
- debugging and logging :-)
